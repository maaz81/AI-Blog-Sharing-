    "content": "Examination systems are undergoing significant transformation as education evolves. Digital exams are becoming more common, allowing institutions to assess students efficiently and with greater flexibility. Open-book and project-based evaluations are also being used to test critical thinking and application skills rather than rote memorization. There is a growing push for continuous assessment models to replace high-stakes testing, which can add stress and may not reflect true learning. In addition, AI and data analytics are being used to personalize assessments, monitor performance, and reduce academic dishonesty through smarter proctoring systems.",
